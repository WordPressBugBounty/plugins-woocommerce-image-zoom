Add responsive image zoom effects to WooCommerce product images for better visual engagement and a closer look at product details.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Image Zoom is a lightweight and user-friendly plugin that enhances your online store by adding responsive zoom functionality to product images. Designed specifically for WooCommerce, this plugin allows customers to get a closer, high-definition look at product details simply by hovering over or tapping on product images — helping build trust and reduce purchase hesitation.

With multiple zoom styles and customizable settings, WooCommerce Image Zoom gives you full control over how zoom effects appear on single product pages. You can adjust zoom window size, lens shape, magnification level, and animation behavior to match your store’s design and user experience needs, all without writing any code. Whether shoppers are browsing on desktop or touch devices, the zoom effect works smoothly and responsively across screen sizes.

Built for performance and compatibility, this plugin integrates seamlessly with modern WooCommerce themes and maintains fast loading times without adding unnecessary bloat. By giving users an immersive product preview experience, WooCommerce Image Zoom can help increase engagement, reduce returns due to unexpected details, and drive higher conversions.
